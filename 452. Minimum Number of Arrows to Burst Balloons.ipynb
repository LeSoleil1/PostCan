Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons**](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)\n","\n","There are some spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter, and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. The start is always smaller than the end.\n","\n","An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps traveling up infinitely.\n","\n","Given an array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend], return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.\n","\n"," \n","\n","Example 1:\n","```\n","Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]\n","Output: 2\n","Explanation: One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).\n","```\n","Example 2:\n","```\n","Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]\n","Output: 4\n","```\n","\n","Example 3:\n","```\n","Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]\n","Output: 2\n","```\n","\n","Example 4:\n","```\n","Input: points = [[1,2]]\n","Output: 1\n","```\n","\n","Example 5:\n","```\n","Input: points = [[2,3],[2,3]]\n","Output: 1\n","``` \n","\n","Constraints:\n","\n","- `0 <= points.length <= 10^4`\n","- `points.length == 2`\n","- `-2^31 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1`"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0b-PAgEpPKoE"},"source":["class Solution:\n","    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n","        if len(points) == 1:\n","            return 1\n","        if len(points) == 0:\n","            return 0\n","        merged = True\n","        inter  = sorted([rows[:] for rows in points])\n","        while merged == True:\n","            # print(intervals)\n","            i = 0\n","            merged = False\n","            while i < len(inter):\n","                j = i + 1\n","                if j < len(inter) :\n","                    if inter[j][0] <= inter[i][1] <= inter[j][1]:\n","                        inter[i][0] = inter[j][0]\n","                        # print(inter[j],'is removed')\n","                        inter.pop(j)\n","                        i = i -1\n","                        merged = True\n","                    elif inter[i][0] <= inter[j][0] and inter[i][1] >= inter[j][1]:\n","                        inter[i][0] = inter[j][0]\n","                        inter[i][1] = inter[j][1]\n","                        # print(inter[j],'is removed')\n","                        inter.pop(j)\n","                        i = i -1\n","                        merged = True\n","                i += 1\n","        # print(inter)\n","        return len(inter)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
